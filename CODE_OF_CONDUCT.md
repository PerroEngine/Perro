# Perro Code of Conduct

Perro is an open, inclusive, and civil community. This Code of Conduct reflects the spirit of the Rust community: be helpful, be humble, assume good intent, and prioritize constructive collaboration.

## Standards

- Be welcoming and respectful to everyone regardless of background or identity.
- Explain problems clearly and kindly; teach and guide contributors who make mistakes.
- Give actionable, constructive feedback — include examples, tests, or suggested fixes.
- Avoid pedantry and unhelpful corrections. Do not respond with “gotcha” or “um actually” style comments.
- Offer help with CI, tests, and reviews when people struggle.

## Unacceptable behavior

The following are not tolerated:

- Personal attacks, insults, slurs, or harassment.
- Targeted or persistent public shaming or humiliation.
- Threats, doxxing, or stalking.
- Intentionally derailing conversations or repeatedly reopening settled disputes.

## Reporting

If you witness or experience issues:

- Open a GitHub issue titled "Code of Conduct report" and request maintainers convert it to a private discussion.

Provide timestamps, links, and a brief factual description. Reports will be handled discreetly.

## Enforcement

Maintainers will review reports and may:

- Request clarification or mediate,
- Issue warnings,
- Temporarily or permanently restrict participation,
- Escalate to platform-level enforcement (GitHub) if necessary.

Actions will be proportionate and intended to protect community health.

## Scope

This policy applies to all Perro project spaces: GitHub issues, PRs, code comments, chats, meetings, and events.

## Questions

For questions about this Code of Conduct, contact the project maintainers.

Thank you for helping keep Perro constructive and welcoming.
