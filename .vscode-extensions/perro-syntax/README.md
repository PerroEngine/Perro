# Perro Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting for `.pup` and `.fur` files.

## Installation

To install this extension in VS Code/Cursor:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
2. Type "Developer: Install Extension from Location..."
3. Navigate to and select this folder: `.vscode-extensions/pup-language`
4. Reload the window (press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type "Reload Window")

After reloading, `.pup` and `.fur` files should have syntax highlighting!

**Note:** The extension must be installed from the location for it to work. VS Code/Cursor doesn't automatically load extensions from `.vscode` folders.
